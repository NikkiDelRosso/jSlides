=======

Just another jQuery slideshow.

Example

Prerequisites
-------------
This project requires [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [JsRender](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsrender).

Motivation
----------
My motivation for creating this project (instead of using one of the many existing jQuery slideshows out there) was that I was unable to find a slideshow which supported a no-JS fallback without having every slide image embedded and downloaded immediately.
